It’s been [a while]({{< ref "makefile-plugin-1.5.md">}}) since I wrote about the [Makefile plugin](/projects/makefile/) last time.

{{< figure src="/projects/makefile/makefile-3.png" width="900" height="540" caption="Makefile" >}}

Over the last one and a half year, the plugin got many new features:

* Shell language injection in recipes and <code>``</code> blocks
* Spellchecker support
* Variable references which allow completion, rename, and searching for usages
* Many other bug fixes

If you need to edit Makefiles, [install the plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/9333-makefile-support) now!

And don't forget to give the plugin 5 stars review, and star it on <i class="fa fa-github" style="color: rgb(23,21,21)"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com/kropp/intellij-makefile).
