The festive season has begun. This is the most wonderful time of the year! But it is cold and gray in the Northern Hemisphere now and many people will spend forthcoming holidays on a sofa in the living room. What will you be doing? Instead of watching yet another TV series or Christmas movie, I'd like to suggest you choosing something different this time.

For example, there is a huge collection of great educational videos from [TED](https://www.ted.com/) conferences. They are usually short, but always very inspiring. To start with, check [25 most popular talks](https://www.ted.com/playlists/171/the_most_popular_talks_of_all) or try these, which are my favorites:

* [Your body language shapes who you are](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are) by Amy Cuddy
* [How fear of nuclear power is hurting the environment](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_shellenberger_how_fear_of_nuclear_power_is_hurting_the_environment) by Michael Shellenberger
* [Got a meeting? Take a walk](https://www.ted.com/talks/nilofer_merchant_got_a_meeting_take_a_walk) by Nilofer Merchant

If you are into programming, you can't miss this famous talk by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/):

Check out his other talks too.

Many big software development conferences publish videos, including [Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg), [GoTo](https://www.youtube.com/user/GotoConferences), [NDC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdw38Cw6jcm0atBPA39a0Q) and many others. If you don't know where to start, look for prominent speakers, like [Venkat Subramaniam](http://www.agiledeveloper.com/), [Kevlin Henney](http://curbralan.com/) or my JetBrains colleagues [Hadi Hariri](http://hadihariri.com/) and [Trisha Gee](https://trishagee.github.io/). Choose any of their talks and you wouldn't be disappointed.

Also try searching YouTube on a topic you're interested in, and you'll find lots of interesting content there. It is also a great opportunity to learn something new: watch some introductory video and decide whether you need to learn that technology or framework deeper.

Speaking of education, you can replace weekly TV series with online courses. Free courses are available on many platforms, including [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), and [edX](https://www.edx.org/). I recently attended courses about [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/) there and can definitely recommend these. Udacity offers many courses in collaboration with leading vendors. For example, there is [Android Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) course co-created by Google. And on edX I've seen good language courses.

There is one more thing I'd like to share:

> #### If you want something you've never had, then you've got to do something you've never done.

I cannot agree more. If you do New Year Resolutions take this one.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! See you in 2017.
