 * There is immediate feedback to one’s actions
 * There is a balance between challenges and skills
 * Action and awareness are merged
 * Distractions are excluded from consciousness
 * There is no worry of failure
 * Self-consciousness disappears
 * The sense of time becomes distorted
 * The activity becomes an end in itself
