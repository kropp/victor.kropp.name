It's not the first time I start the blog and not the last, for sure.

But this time I'm pretty sure I have enough to say.

And I want to start with brief description on how this site is built and why.

Let's start with why. It's not a secret that I'm working with C# and .NET intensively 5 days a week. Also I develop some Android apps in my free time, so I have enough experience with Java too. But my interest doesn't end here. I've been a fan of [Python][python] for years. And this is the first point: I looked for something pythonic to power my personal page.

However, I've realised soon that writing Yet Another Blog Engine on my own is complete waste of time. Also [Django][django] is a fantastic framework, but I don't need all its powers for this small website. This is the second point: I decided to use static site generator written in Python with some Django flavor. [Hyde][hyde] seems to be the ultimate solution.

Hyde allowed me to build the basics in a few minutes. *rsync* allowed me to deploy generated pages to my own server in a few seconds.

I'm happy with chosen solution and will continue improving my site in a near future. Meanwhile you could check source code at [Github][sources].
