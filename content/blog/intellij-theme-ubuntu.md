Following yesterday’s [announcement](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/03/brighten-up-your-day-add-color-to-intellij-idea/) of custom themes support for IntelliJ IDEA, I’m excited to release a preview of [Ubuntu theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12105-ubuntu-theme). It is based on awesome Darcula theme, but is tuned to match Yaru color scheme introduced in Ubuntu 18.10.

Creating a new visual theme for JetBrains’ IDEs is now [easier than ever](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2019/03/creating-custom-themes-for-intellij-platform-ides/), check out the documentation and try it yourself. You can tweak colors and apply changes instantly right in the editor!

The source code of this theme is available on <i class="fa fa-github" style="color: rgb(23,21,21)"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com/kropp/intellij-theme-ubuntu). It is work in progress and Pull Requests are welcome!

[Give it a try](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12105-ubuntu-theme) and let me know what you think.
