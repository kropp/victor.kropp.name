title: 100% Code Coverage

If you write unit tests and don't cover all business logic in your project, you are doing it wrong.

{{< figure src="http://cs4.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2014/03/24/7/1395654372_1357302756.jpg" width="1000" attr="pikabu.ru" attrlink="http://pikabu.ru/story/ne_bud_kak_vse_lomay_sistemu_2103232" >}}

Each untested line of code may contain a bug. Only full coverage can provide confidence in your code.

Integration tests may help to increase this important metric because they cover more lines of code at once.

However, they are harder to write, so don't waste your time.

Much, much harder.

If somebody tells you that some issues may only be discovered in integration testing, don't believe them!

You don't need integration tests.

Your code will always be used in the way you expected it to be used.
